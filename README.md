# Delegated Wallet

A delegated wallet uses a plugin like approach for letting decentralized applications have access to your wallet. The wallet keeps an internal list of delegates that can transfer ether or any ERC20 token from the wallet. 

Everchain provides a curated list of approved plugins for anyone to use and build from.

## Decentralized Delegate

These "plugins" are completely decentralized and immune to tampering or change. If you don't want users to have to deal with adding/removing delegates you should use the Everchain Payment Delegate.

## Everchain Payment Delegate

The Everchain Payment Delegate is owned and secured by the Everchain Project but it allows seemless access to new and upgraded contracts for users who would prefer a hands off approach every time a new or better plugin comes along.
